This directory contains sample SCEP messages that can be used to verify that
your SCEP implementation is producing correctly-formatted data.  You can
display the messages with a tool like dumpasn1,
https://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~pgut001/dumpasn1.c.

The sample messages are broken down into requests, scep_reqX.der, and
responses, scep_respX.der.  The value X denotes the level of processing for
each message.  0 = innermost message, the PKCSReq or CertRep.  1 = encrypted
form of level 0 message.  2 = signed form of level 1 message.  So for example
in the sample messages below scep_req0.der is the PKCSReq, scep_req1.der is
the EnvelopedData form of the PKCSReq, and scep_req2.der is the SignedData
form of the EnvelopedData form of the PKCSReq.

Sample standard SCEP request and response messages:

scep_req0.der 
scep_req1.der 
scep_req2.der 
scep_resp0.der
scep_resp1.der
scep_resp2.der
